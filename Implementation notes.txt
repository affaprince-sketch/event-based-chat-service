1. Cummunication: FastAPI HTTP for REST; WebSockets for real-time subscriptions.

2. Event bus: Used asyncio.Queue

3. Persistence: Used SQLite with minimal schema

4. Session management: In-memory sessions with simple room model, no other session management.

5. Mocked AI agent: Used an Agent class (abstract base) with a rule-based implementation that reacts to certain keywords.

6. Things that didn't implement due to time constrains:

- Authentication and security related didn't implement, no user auth check on server side.
- Very simple client script, no fancy front-end UI client.
- Error handling very minimal.
- Message schema and validation very simple.
- Scaling, not very good for scaling, replace with Redis or Kafka will be better.
- Concurrentcy consideration, not implemented, in-memory queue could grow very fast.
- pytest only covers simple Event bus publishing test
